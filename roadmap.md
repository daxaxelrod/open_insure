# Roadmap

| Just some ideas, sort of operates as a loose todo list.

## Policies
 - Policies have hard start and stop dates, rolling coverage requires a new policy to be created
 - A user can however join a policy mid flight and only be responsible for premiums until the end of the policy
 
## Todo
 - Allow for a user to terminate their participation in a policy if the policy allows for it
 - Payouts should hit the escrow agent, logging or otherwise
